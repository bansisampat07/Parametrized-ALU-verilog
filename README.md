## 1. Project Overview
This project implements a scalable, **parameterized Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** using Verilog HDL. Unlike standard fixed-width ALUs, this design utilizes Verilog parameters to allow instant reconfiguration of bit-width (e.g., 4-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit) without modifying the core logic. 

The design focuses on **architectural completeness**, featuring a full suite of status flags (Zero, Carry, Overflow, Negative) crucial for decision-making in processor control paths.

## 2. Key Features
* **Scalability:** Built with `parameter WIDTH` for flexible bus sizing.
* **Flag Generation:** Automatic calculation of NZCV (Negative, Zero, Carry, Overflow) flags.
* **Operation Support:** Handles Arithmetic (Add/Sub), Logic (AND/OR/XOR), Shifting and comparision operations.
* **Verification:** Validated using a **self-checking testbench** covering corner cases (Signed Overflow, Unsigned Carry).

## 4. Verification Strategy
The design was verified using a **Self-Checking Testbench** strategy to ensure robustness. 

* **Directed Testing:** Specifically targeted "corner cases" such as:
    * **Signed Overflow:** Adding two large positive numbers to produce a negative result (`4 + 4 = -8`).
    * **Unsigned Rollover:** Adding max values to trigger Carry (`15 + 1 = 0`).
* **Automated Checks:** The testbench compares the UUT output against an expected behavioral model and prints `PASS/FAIL`.

> Functional verification waveform in Xilinx Vivado demonstrating three critical logic scenarios:
> (1) Unsigned Rollover where 15+1 triggers the Carry flag
> (2) Subtraction (5-5) successfully validating the Zero flag assertion
> (3) Signed Overflow where 4+4 correctly triggers both Overflow and Negative flags.
